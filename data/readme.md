# readme - sample data
This is a small subset of the "partytime" dataset. This dataset is derived from SRA data, and got its name from the fact it was our last batch of SRA data. The samples here are not included in the default alldiffs_mask2ref.L.fixed.pb input tree and will be newly added if you run with tree_nine_local.json -- with the exception of SAMEA104684942, which will be filtered out for having 25% of its sites being low-coverage (unless you set max_low_coverage_sites > 0.2501106191681257)

Earlier versions of this pipeline used a tree called L1_L4.pb as the sample tree. Don't use that tree. It has duplicated samples and it breaks if you try to reroot it.
